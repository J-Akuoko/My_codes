            <p class = "overview_1">The shift from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources is crucial for environmental sustainability. Here at the <strong> S</strong>ubsurface <strong> E</strong>ngineering and <strong> S</strong>torage <em> <strong>(SEAS)</strong> </em> Lab, subsurface storage solutions are being developed to manage seasonal energy demand fluctuations effectively. Using advanced synchrotron techniques such as imaging, spectroscopy, and scattering, we investigate the intricate microstructure of target rocks, fluid dynamics under subsurface conditions (including hydrogen, heat, compressed air, and synthetic methane), and chemical interactions with host rocks. This research spans length scales from sub-nanometer to millimeters, complemented by lab-based methods like SEM, TEM, and various measurements (e.g., adsorption, permeability, ICP-MS). Our focus also extends to understanding water-rock interactions for hydrogen production and leveraging artificial intelligence for geochemical and rock analysis. Collaborations with research councils (e.g., NERC, EPSRC) and industry leaders (e.g., BP, Shell) drive our efforts to advance scientific boundaries and enhance industrial applications in subsurface energy storage, aiming to improve energy efficiency while minimizing environmental impact.</p>
