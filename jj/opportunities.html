    <p>The Subsurface Energy and Storage Lab is open to collaborating with researchers who wish to undertake modelling and experimental works in CO2 sequestration, hydrogen production and storage, geochemistry,  and rock analysis and characterisation</p>
    <p> Aspiring graduate candidates are urged to reach out to  <strong><a href="mailto:lin.ma@manchester.ac.uk" target="blank"> Dr Lin Ma</a> </strong>
        before submitting their applications to learn more about the opportunities at hand. Please provide a brief overview of any past research engagements (note: previous research experience is not obligatory for admission!) and outline your current research and educational interests. Having previous degrees in Geology/Earth Science, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Soil Science, Environmental Engineering, and Planetary Science can be advantageous.</p>
