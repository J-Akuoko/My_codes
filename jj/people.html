        <em><p class = "lin_ma_about"><strong > Principal Investigator</strong> <br> <br> Dr Lin Ma is a lecturer (equivalent to assistant professor) focusing on Multi-scale imaging and characterization of rocks (Digital rocks) in geoenergy reservoirs and subsurface energy storage. She is the Academic lead/co-chair of Women@manchester staff network (with > 600 members) at the university, and leading on subsurface energy and storage at University of Manchester at Harwell.
            Her current research aims to build novel and advanced 3D/4D digital approaches and correlative experiments to fully understand the complicated pore networks and the reactions of subsurface energy (e.g. natural gas, geothermal, hydrogen and CO2) with rocks under subsurface conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, and chemistry) across multiple scales (nm to cm). <br> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=46pus1wAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lin-ma-392b1766/?originalSubdomain=uk">  LinkedIn</a>
