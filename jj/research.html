        <p> At the SEAS Lab, our focus is on creating underground storage systems that can efficiently handle changes in energy demand throughout the year. We employ cutting-edge synchrotron techniques such as imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the inner workings of specific rock formations and to analyze how fluids behave under the ground.
            Some of our current research are highlighted below:

        <strong> <em><p>CO2-induced micro-mechanical alterations of mudstone Caprock: Examples</em>
            from the Mercia Mudstone Group, East Irish Sea Basin </p> </strong>
        <p>Mechanical properties of caprock are important for subsurface energy sequestration as they determine the rock
            stability under the influence of external forces. Despite some advantages, there is a lack of knowledge regarding
            the interplay between rock texture and mechanical properties and their impact on the caprock stability within a
            short-term fluid-rock reaction period. Typical caprock samples from the Mercia Mudstone Group in the East Irish
            Sea Basin are studied in this work. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to identify minerology and local heterogeneity characteristics.
            Nanoindentation tests were conducted before and after CO2-brine-rock reaction to investigate the changes of
            micro-mechanical properties. After CO2-brine treatment, significant dolomite dissolution was observed in all
            samples (although dolomite content was only minor in some samples). In contrast, the micro-texture of other
            minerals showed no significant changes indicating minimal to no dissolution at the current resolution. The
            changes of mechanical properties are lower than expected, which are probably related to the impaired cementation induced by the retained water in pore throats and relatively rough surface after reaction. For long-term
            carbon sequestration, the layered depositional characteristics of different phases may not only form a barrier
            to prevent fluids leaking upward, but also complement each other in mechanical properties to maintain stability.
            This study improves the understanding of the effect of microscale structural and micro-mechanical changes on
            caprock stability in carbon sequestration related applications. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236122032276">Download</a>

            <strong> <em><p>Potential for CO2 storage in shale basins in China</em></strong> <br>
            <p>China is the second largest shale gas and oil producing country possessing large and significant shale basins, and it is also one of the top carbon emitting countries. 
                Therefore, there is significant potential to store CO 2 in shales in China to remove the carbon emission and enhance and gas recovery simultaneously. This research provides a comprehensive prediction of potentials of CO 2 storage in major shale gas/oil basins in China based on most recent publications where density variation of CO 2 at different subsurface conditions is considered and the different stages of development are classified. We optimise the calculation equations for shale gas and oil respectively, and further classified the three tiers (i.e. commercial, potential and possible reservoirs) in the calculation to prioritise the sequestration site selection.
                A total of around 6194 Gt, CO 2 sequestration in shales, including 172 Gt for commercial, 849 Gt for potential and 5147 Gt for possible storage, equivalent to a total of 620 years’ carbon emissions in China is expected. These can be realised in around 20 years, 20–50 years and 50–100 years respectively. For future applications, more concerns should be on the evaluation criteria of sequestration sites in shales, CO2 fracturing mechanisms and potential leakage, multi-phase seepage and reactions, and environmental monitoring systems. As a comprehensive assessment of potentials of CO 2 storage in shale basins in China, 
                this paper will provide an important guide for future academic studies, industrial operations and government policy making. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583624000033">Download</a> </p>
               
            <strong> <em><p>Revealing subsurface dynamics: Imaging techniques for optimizing underground energy storage
            </em> </strong>
            <p> Subsurface processes play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and viability of key applications with significant technical and economic implications, including hydrocarbon production, CO2/H2 geo-storage, and environmental engineering. A comprehensive understanding of natural behavior including microstructures, morphologies, and various petrophysical properties at pore scale is vital for optimizing the utilization of underground energy storage formations. Despite ongoing efforts, the behavior of diverse natural phenomena in the subsurface remains inadequately understood. This work leverages imaging techniques in conjunction with flow displacement experiments in investigating various natural phenomena, such as CO2/H2 geo-sequestration and fracture propagation. Additionally, the significance of microfluidic experiments in studying the dynamics of multiphase flows are briefly underscored. As a conclusion, porous media characterisation at pore scale is valuable for the advance in the understanding of natural phenomenon in subsurface engineering and the subsurface sciences, and upscaling them across space and time.   <a href="https://www.yandy-ager.com/index.php/ager/article/view/1142">Download</a> </p>
            
            <strong> <em><p>Microfacies and diagenetic alteration in a semi-deep to deep lacustrine shale: The Yanchang formation in the Ordos basin, China
            </em> </strong>
            <p> The mineralogical development and diagenetic sequence of lacustrine shales in the Chang 7 Member of the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin are detailed studied to predict exploration potential of shale oil in that area. A model of their depositional system and a diagenetic diagram are proposed in this study. Through detailed petrographic, mineralogical, and elemental analyses, four distinct shale types are identified: argillaceous shale, siliceous shale, calcareous shale, and carbonate, clay, and silt-bearing shale. The main diagenetic process in argillaceous shale is the transformation of illite to smectite, negatively impacting shale porosity. Siliceous shale undergoes carbonate cementation and quartz dissolution, contributing to increased porosity, particularly in mesopores. Calcareous shale experiences diagenesis characterised by carbonate formation and dissolution, with a prevalence of siderite. In carbonate, clay, and silt-bearing shale, the dissolution of K-feldspar contributes to illitization of kaolinite. Argillaceous shale, characterised by more clay minerals and lower mesopore volume, is identified as a potential hydrocarbon seal. Siliceous shale, with the highest pore volume and abundant inter-mineral pores, emerges as a promising shale oil reservoir. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of source rock properties, aiding in the prediction of shale oil exploration potential in the studied area.
